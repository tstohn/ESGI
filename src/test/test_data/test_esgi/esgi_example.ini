# default 0, means the reverse read is a 'true' reverse and we sequentially map the pattern from 5' to 3' of forward read and then continue
# with reverse complement of reverse, set independent=1 if you want to continue mapping the reverse read independenlty from its own start (no reverse complement)
# in this case there has to be a [-] element in the pattern, everything before is mapped sequentially to forward, after sequentially to reverse
